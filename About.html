						<p>Hi, I'm Kritik. Welcome to my website.</p>

						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p>

							My name is Kritik Mirg and I am a Junior studying Information and Data Science at the University of Maryland - College Park. Outside of my coursework, I like to stay involved on campus and try new things, especially food. On campus you will probably find me making flyers for events as the Director of Marketing of UMD's Indian Student Association, and allocating funds for Maryland Minza as the Director of Finance. You can also catch me providing pro bono consulting services to local businesses and nonprofits as a Business Analyst for UMD’s chapter of Consult Your Community. <br>


							<br>Whenever I get a chance, I try to take advantage of our proximity to Washington D.C. and explore new parts of the city. Growing up in New Jersey, only a train ride away from New York City, I love to see the juxtaposition between the fact pace of the Big Apple and the high stakes of our Nation’s Capital. If you can’t find me at any of these places, you’ll probably find me at my favorite restaurant on-campus, Seoul Spice.

								<h3>Data and Storytelling</h3>
								<p>If I had to choose one word to describe myself it would Storyteller. As an aspiring Data Analyst and Consultant, I choose to approach every problem as if it were a story. I believe that the best way to find solutions is by using data, and I am always curious to see what story the data is trying to tell us. Through my coursework, I have become very familiar with different storytelling techniques. As an Information Science major with a focus in Data Science, I’ve gained a lot of experience uncovering stories with analytical packages like Python, R, and SQL, and presenting them with tools like Tableau. I hope to one day work in a field where I get to bridge the gap between technology and business, and use this intersection to find 21st century solutions to 21st century problems.</p>
